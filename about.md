<p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Why I get bored?</strong> It is not meant to be a humble brag or false modesty because I do not like to pretend to be either a good scientist or a bad scientist. <mark>I get bored when I run out of challenges.</mark> So I need a lot of challenges (and pressure actually.. haha) <mark>to keep myself productive and avoid boredom.</mark></p>



<p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Who am I?</strong> <mark>A passionate and motivated</mark> Fresh Graduate of Physics from Universitas Negeri Malang. I am is fast learner person who is always to do things in a efficient way. I like to learn new things to improve my skills, experience, and networking. I have an interest in <mark>science, engineering, technology information, arts and philosophy.</mark> I have several certifications in technology including from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Alibaba Cloud, Coursera, Dicoding, IBM and others which can be seen and proven on my LinkedIn account or on my personal website. I like spending my free time to learning new stuff, reading and doing a little bit of my hobby sometimes.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Disclaimer!</strong> <strong>For all my collaborators..</strong> I kindly to ask you to be patient with me. Depending on the research topics that we are explore, we might be able to contribute to society as well as getting lost in the jungle. Although some of my research projects look credible, I must admit that they are far from a good standard of quality. And I'm still working on it. I hope we can make great collaboration, and contribute to science as well.</p>
