<p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Why I get bored?</strong> It is not meant to be a humble brag or false modesty because I do not like to pretend to be either a good scientist or a bad scientist. <mark>I get bored when I run out of challenges.</mark> So I need a lot of challenges (and pressure actually.. I just wanna be strong like Diamond) <mark>to keep myself productive and avoid boredom.</mark></p>
